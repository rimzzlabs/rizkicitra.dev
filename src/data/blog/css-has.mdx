## Introduction

Web Developer will never leave their CSS behind because it's one of the cores of the technology behind the web.

Well, since CSS got upgraded to version 3 in 1998, A lot of things happened, and until now, CSS has already got many features, such as `:has()` pseudo-class.

### What is pseudo-class?

In CSS, A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class `:hover` can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.

I'm not going to talk much about what pseudo-class is, but here's a simple explanation of it, we will have a button with a background color black, and the color of the text will be white, and also with some padding.

```css
.button {
  padding: 0.75rem;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

Result:

<ContentImage src='/static/css-has-btn.gif' width={313} height={199} loading='lazy' alt='regular button' />

We have a nice button there, now let's add interaction, such as color change when the user hovers over the element with `:hover` pseudo-class.

```css
.button {
  padding: 0.75rem;
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Now the button would be like this:

<ContentImage
  width={313}
  height={199}
  loading='lazy'
  alt='regular button with hover'
  src='/static/css-has-btn-hover.gif'
/>

After I added the `:hover` pseudo-class, the button will change it's color if I hover over the element, that's my simple explanation about pseudo-class.

## What is :has() pseudo-class?

The functional `:has()` CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the relative selectors that are passed as an argument match at least one element when anchored against this element. This pseudo-class presents a way of selecting a parent element or a previous sibling element concerning a reference element by taking a forgiving relative selector list as an argument.

- **Q:** Why it's called a functional?
- **A:** Because this type of pseudo-class accepts parameters rather than just calling it

CSS `:has()` pseudo-class will accept [forgiving relative element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list#forgiving_selector_list) and will apply a style if the parameters are valid as [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).

Let's take a look at this example of how the CSS pseudo-class `:has()` works

```html
<main>
  <section>
    <h1>Punctuation</h1>
    <p>A simple punctuation will never arrive at a dragon's house tonight.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id="vergil">Punctuation</h1>
    <p>Hi Andrew can I borrow your pen?</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet constectum adpisicing elit.</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

```css
section:has(h1#vergil) {
  color: blue;
}
```

The result is going to be like this

<ContentImage width={600} height={290} loading='lazy' alt='css has example' src='/static/css-has-example.gif' />

So what is happening? as you can see, I'm targetting **the whole section** element that has an `h1` element with an **id** of **vergil**, and then **the whole section** will have a text color of blue.
